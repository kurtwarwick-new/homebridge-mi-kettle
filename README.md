# Homebridge Apple TV - Now Playing

A [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin that exposes Apple TV devices to Homekit, along with it's current Power State, Playback State and Now Playing Information.

## Overview

This plugin exposes the Apple TV as a switch device, with the switch power state representing the Apple TV power state. The playback state is exposed through the Active charceristic and all other now playing information get's exposed through customised characteristics.

The media type is calculated by checking artist and album information. This characterist comes in handy if you would like to setup automations that dim light for only videos and not music.

** Note: ** The now playing information are exposed as custom charactersitics, which means that the Apple Home App will not be able to read these. You will need to use an app such as [Home+ 4]:https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home-4/id995994352 or [Eve for Homekit]:https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eve-for-homekit/id917695792.
